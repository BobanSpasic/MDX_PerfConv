MDX Performance Converter wasn't meant to be a file-extractor, but because the whole infrastructure was already in place,
I just went ahead and used it.

Extract function can be used to extract DX-related data from various file formats used by various librarian software.
Similar functionality is already present in MDX Tool (another tool of mine), but MDX Tool is concentrated on DX7.
The extract functionality in MDX Performance Converter is concentrated at ripping DX7II (Mk2) data from files.
This includes TX802, which is also Mk2-based.

At the moment of writting of this text, the only supported format to extract data from, is Sound Diver 3 Library.
More will be added in the future. DX Manager and Midi Quest are planned.

Extract function does not convert directly to MiniDexed INI format, but instead it creates a couple of SysEx files.
The files with .AV. in name are AMEM/VMEM files. The files with .P. are performances, and the files with .ALL. are All-in-One (AMEM/VMEM/PMEM) conversions.
The last one should be usable for converting to MiniDexed INI files.
