Mark:

  Here are the 802 banks I mentioned. You might enjoy how I programmed these
voices: I ran sequences on the C1 through the desktop machine running the
Sideman D/TX editor, everything gets tested immediately, real-time FM program-
ming. I know people do it all the time, it's a gas, really the only way to
program any synth.

  The banks are mixed bags, though they can probably be sorted into some kind
of representative order. There are tweakings of patches from various sources,
patches built up from randomization procedures, voices made up from scratch,
restricted-parameter alterations, etc.

  The banks are in MIDIex (version 2) format.

  I hope you can find something to enjoy and use here.
